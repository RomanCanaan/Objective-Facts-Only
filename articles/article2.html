                <h3>Global Health Emergency</h3>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the rise in mpox cases a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), following a recommendation from the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee. This decision highlights the global risk posed by the ongoing outbreaks of mpox, particularly in Africa.</p>

                <p>Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a rare but dangerous infection similar to the eradicated smallpox virus. It has recently seen a surge in cases, with over 14,000 reported globally this year, resulting in 524 deaths.</p>

                <h3>WHO's Response Strategy</h3>
                <p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized the need for a coordinated international response. The virus has been spreading rapidly in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, with different clades of the virus contributing to the outbreaks.</p>

                <p>The WHO is working with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners to address these outbreaks. Efforts include providing diagnostic equipment, supporting laboratory work, conducting case investigations, contact tracing, and training healthcare workers. A regional response plan has been developed, requiring an initial $15 million in funding, with $1.45 million already allocated from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies.</p>

                <h3>Emergency Vaccination Efforts</h3>
                <p>To combat the outbreak, WHO has recommended two vaccines currently being used under an Emergency Use Listing (EUL). This measure aims to accelerate vaccine access in lower-income countries that have yet to issue national regulatory approval. Partners like UNICEF will help gather and distribute vaccines to ensure equitable access to these essential medical tools.</p>

                <h3>Next Steps and Recommendations</h3>
                <p>The WHO has extended its standing recommendations under the IHR to monitor mpox cases for another year. These recommendations focus on enhancing community protection, providing clinical care guidance, and adapting public health measures to local contexts.</p>

                <p>In the days and weeks ahead, WHO will continue to coordinate the global response, working closely with affected countries to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.</p>
