                <h3>Creating a New Era of Marketing Magic</h3>
                <p>When The Coca-Cola Company produces thirst-quenching marketing, the creative elements of campaigns aren’t just left to chance — there’s a recipe for the magic. Now, the beverage company, through its partnership with WPP Open X, is beginning to scale its global campaigns with generative AI from NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA NIM microservices.</p>

                <p>“With NVIDIA, we can personalize and customize Coke and meals imagery across 100-plus markets, delivering on hyperlocal relevance with speed and at global scale,” said Samir Bhutada, global vice president of StudioX Digital Transformation at The Coca-Cola Company.</p>

                <p>Coca-Cola has been working with WPP to develop digital twin tools and roll out Prod X — a custom production studio experience created specifically for the beverage maker to use globally.</p>

                <h3>Adopting Cutting-Edge Technology</h3>
                <p>WPP announced today at SIGGRAPH that The Coca-Cola Company will be an early adopter for integrating the new NVIDIA NIM microservices for Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) into its Prod X roadmap. OpenUSD is a 3D framework that enables interoperability between software tools and data types for building virtual worlds. NIM inference microservices provide models as optimized containers.</p>

                <p>The USD Search NIM allows WPP to tap into a large archive of models to create on-brand assets, and the USD Code NIM can be used to assemble them into scenes. These NIM microservices will enable Prod X users to create 3D advertising assets that contain culturally relevant elements on a global scale, using prompt engineering to quickly make adjustments to AI-generated images so that brands can better target their products at local markets.</p>

                <h3>Transforming 3D Engineering and Art</h3>
                <p>WPP said that the NVIDIA NIM microservices will have a lasting impact on the 3D engineering and art world. The USD Search NIM can make WPP’s massive visual asset libraries quickly available via written prompts. The USD Code NIM allows developers to enter prompts and get Python code to create novel 3D worlds.</p>

                <p>“The beauty of the solution is that it compresses multiple phases of the production process into a single interface and process,” said Perry Nightingale, senior vice president of creative AI at WPP, of the new NIM microservices. “It empowers artists to get more out of the technology and create better work.”</p>

                <h3>Redefining Content Production with Production Studio</h3>
                <p>WPP recently announced the release of Production Studio on WPP Open, the company’s intelligent marketing operating system powered by AI. Co-developed with its production company, Hogarth, Production Studio taps into the Omniverse development platform and OpenUSD for its generative AI-enabled product configurator workflows.</p>

                <p>Production Studio can streamline and automate multilingual text, image, and video creation, simplifying content creation for advertisers and marketers, and directly addresses the challenges advertisers continue to face in producing brand-compliant and product-accurate content at scale.</p>

                <p>“Our groundbreaking research with NVIDIA Omniverse for the past few years, and the research and development associated with having built our own core USD pipeline and decades of experience in 3D workflows, is what made it possible for us to stand up a tailored experience like this for The Coca-Cola Company,” said Priti Mhatre, managing director for strategic consulting and AI at Hogarth.</p>

                <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
                <p>SIGGRAPH attendees can hear more about WPP’s efforts by joining the company’s session on “Robotics, Generative AI, and OpenUSD: How WPP Is Building the Future of Creativity.”</p>

                <p>NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will also be featured at the event in fireside chats with Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WIRED Senior Writer Lauren Goode. Watch the talks and other sessions from NVIDIA at SIGGRAPH 2024 on demand.</p>
